# Fuzzy-Logic-and-Finite-State-Machine-race-car
Tests the efficiency of Fuzzy Logic AI against Finite State Machine AI (Developed in Processing Engine)

The race line is user controlled. The forward speed (vertical velocity) is assumed to be constant for both test subjects (car Fuzzy(red) and car FSM(purple))
This application tests which AI technique provides a better a better result for a racecar AI (Assumption: The faster the AI car approaches the race line, the better it's effciency)
