# Fuzzy-Logic-and-Finite-State-Machine-race-car
Tests the efficiency of Fuzzy Logic AI against Finite State Machine AI (Developed in Processing Engine)
#About the project#

The race line is user controlled. The forward speed (vertical velocity) is assumed to be constant for both test subjects (car Fuzzy(red) and car FSM(purple))
This application tests which AI technique provides a better a better result for a racecar AI (Assumption: The faster the AI car approaches the race line, the better it's effciency)

#
To run the application, run the exe file (For Windows only)

#
Processing Engine file is also attached for those who'd like to run it on the engine
